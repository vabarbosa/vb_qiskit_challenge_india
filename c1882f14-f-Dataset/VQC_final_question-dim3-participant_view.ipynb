    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook we've seen how we can use the VQC class in Aqua to classify the digits `0` and `1`. However, classifying `0` and `1` is relatively simple as digits `0` and `1` are easily distinguishable. `4` and `9` however, are notoriously similar, with a _loop_ on the top and a _line_ on the bottom. This can be corroborated looking at our 2-D t-SNE plot from the previous notebook (Fig.2), we see that `0` and `1` are clustered relatively far from each other making them easily distinguishable, however `4` and `9` are overlapping. In this challenge we are providing you with a dataset with digits reduced to **dimension 3**. For example, in Fig.1 we can see the dimension reduction of the 784 dimension vector for digit `4` into a dimension 3 feature vector. \n",

    "## Challenge Question   \n",
    "Use the VQC method from Aqua to classify the digits `4` and `9` as given in the dataset **challenge_dataset_4_9_dim3_training.csv** provided to you. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Rules and Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your `QuantumCircuit` can have a **maximum of 6 qubits**.\n",
    "* **Cost of the circuit should be less than 2000**.  \n",
    "* You should not change names of the functions `feature_map()` , `variational_circuit()`  and `return_optimal_params()`.\n",
    "* All the functions must return the value types as mentioned. \n",
    "* All circuits must be Qiskit generated.\n",
    "* Best of all submissions is considered for grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Judging criteria \n",
    "\n",
    "* Primary judgement is based on the **accuracy of the model**, higher the better. **Accuracies which differ by less than 0.005 will be considered to be equal**. ex: Accuracies 0.7783 and 0.7741 will be considered to be equal.\n",
    "* If the accuracies are tied, the tie will be broken using **cost of the circuit** as the metric, lower the better. \n",
    "* In the case that both accuracy of the model and cost of the circuit are equal, **time of submission** is taken into account, Earlier the better. \n",
    "\n",
    "_**Important Note:**_ The **leaderboard shown during the progress of the competition** will only display accuracy of the model and is **not the final leaderboard**. Breaking ties between accuracy of the model by considering lower **cost of circuit** will only be done after the competition ends. **The final leaderboard will be announced post the event** which will take into consideration cost of the circuit and time of submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Certificate Eligibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone who scores an **accuracy greater than 0.70 (i.e, 70%) will be eligible for a certificate**. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An explanation on how to calculate the accuracy of the model and the cost of the circuit is given in the end inside the `grade()` function. Before you submit, make sure the grading function is running on your device. To save time you can also use the grading function provided to calculate the accuracy and circuit cost without having to submit your solution onto HackerEarth. Remember, your final score will be determined using the same grading methods as given in this notebook, but will be evaluated on unseen datapoints."
